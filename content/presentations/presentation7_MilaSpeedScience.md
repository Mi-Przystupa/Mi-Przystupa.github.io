Michael Przystupa, a research intern at Université de Montréal, won the audience choice award for his presentation "From Math to Mobility: Empowering People Through Smarter Control" during the grand finale of Mila's Speed Science contest on June 5, 2025.

Speed Science is Mila's signature science communication contest dedicated to AI research, where students follow a professional coaching program in science communication to prepare a 3-minute pitch of their work before presenting it in front of a jury of non-specialists to win the top prize.
